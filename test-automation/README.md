### Instructions
Inside this folder you may find examples of tests routines that eventually can be used inside some automation tool like Jenkins, TravisCI, CircleCI.

It will include examples using test-driven frameworks for Node.js, MongoDB, React.js, Angular, Golang, Java.

### Personal Notes
We all love tests. That is not true, until you understand how important they are and also one get proficiency in write them while coding some new feature or fixing a bug in an existent code source, most of the time, with a time frame limited.

The problem is that 99% of the learning process of a programming language does not start by the thinking process, that what test-driven is in essence, of understand the problem, think the basic scenarios that the solution may be inserted and the expected results or failures from it.

Automate tests, in part is in first place add the tests, then second build the context/architecture to put them in place, so next time they are run without need of human intervention.

Worst case scenario: when to add any kind of test (unit, integration, smoke, end2end) we face the complexity of software demonstrating the architecture/design issue of the software itself.
